## How to use

This application will automatically perform OCR on the contents of the clipboard.

For example, a typical use case on Windows would be to:
* Press WIN+SHIFT+S to snap a screenshot from a selected portion of the screen.
* Wait for the Clipboard OCR app to recognize it
* Click on the text in Clipboard OCR to automatically copy it to Clipboard

Hence, you'll end up with the actual text contents of whatever you snapped from the screen.
